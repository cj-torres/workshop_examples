These files just represent demos for a presentation I gave to the Irvine Data Science club. It introduces two machine learning tools leveraging different notions of complexity from algorithmic complexity and information theory. The IB model is an information bottleneck similar to a VAE, the algorithmic complexity method is different and reduces the network complexity using L0 regularization.
